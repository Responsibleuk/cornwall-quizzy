                                You might even encounter a solution to a problem that you would have never thought of by

                                    you're going through.</h2>

                                <p>Entrepreneurship is said to be a lonely journey, and it often can be. It can feel
                                    like the
                                    weight of
                                    the world is on your shoulders when you have no one in your life to share your
                                    experiences
                                    with.
                                    It can
                                    feel isolating and, more often than not, most entrepreneurs give up because they
                                    just don't
                                    have
                                    the
                                    motivation to keep going.</p>

                                <p>Let's be honest here, startup founders are a bit of a weird bunch. It can be hard to
                                    connect
                                    with
                                    other people because they're unable to see the way you view the world, or comprehend
                                    why you
                                    would be so
                                    passionate about something that it borders on obsession.
                                    What a community of like-minded people provides, more than anything else, is a
                                    support
                                    network
                                    of
                                    people who are going through the exact same journey as you.</p>

                                <p>Even if they're at different stages of the journey, they'll understand what it is
                                    you're
                                    going
                                    through and be able to give you the support you need to keep going.</p>

                                <p>Being an entrepreneur is more than just having the business sense to get a startup up
                                    and
                                    running.
                                    It takes a lot of mental and emotional energy, and having someone, let alone a whole
                                    group
                                    of
                                    people,
                                    to talk to about your journey can be all you need to keep plowing ahead.</p>
